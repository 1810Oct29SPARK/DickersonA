        In the case of world of warcraft a game I hold dear to my heart, the quality of the game has been diminishing, now this isn't
        necessarily due only to decisions that I disagree with by game developers in charge such as removing abilities to make 
        gameplay even more simplistic and further reducing skill cap. Next there is the fact that they made leveling a 
        slower process, they claimed it was to appeal to a group of the playerbase that wanted it to be more challenging,
        however at this time they also switched to a time played metric, and put a cap on experience modifiers to further reduce 
        leveling speed. This means that not only does this affect the players the mentioned, but every other player, and by how 
        unpopular it was <a href= "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20761996118?page=232" alt = "player feedback"> Example</a> 
        you'd think they would have reverted it, but considering the executives make the decisions I doubt developers really have 
        much of a choice.
