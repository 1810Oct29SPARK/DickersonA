        I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.

        All you have to learn here is how to have fun. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. In your world you can create anything you desire. Let your heart be your guide. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.
        
        With practice comes confidence. Isn't that fantastic? Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Let all these things just sort of happen.
