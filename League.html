League of legends, decisions made here were in my opinion to the detriment of the game. The developers started making balance decisions based on
how characters performed in tournaments, where obviously the vast majority of the playerbase would never get to play, personally I believe it would
be far more logical to balance around the average player, because honestly the pro can always adapt to the changes no matter what.
