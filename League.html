League of legends, decisions made here were in my opinion to the detriment of the game. 
The developers started making balance decisions based on how characters performed in tournaments, where obviously the vast
majority of the playerbase would never get to play, personally I believe it wouldbe far more logical to balance around 
the average player, because honestly the pro can always adapt to the changes no matter what.
